eBooks
eBooks and whitepapers are an essential part of our brand. In addition to some templates and cover layouts, here you'll find design notes and accessibility requirements.
Covers

Cover pages should speak to the content while paying respect to the sophisticated and enterprise-grade writing inside.

Two eBook cover examples showing light and dark mode versions of 'How agentic AI is accelerating DevOps'.
Layout

Interior pages should favor comfortable reading experiences. This isn’t the place for illustrations or attention grabbing graphics. Try to keep type sizes subtle and prevent distracted reading flow or unbalanced headings, supporting content, or UI elements.
